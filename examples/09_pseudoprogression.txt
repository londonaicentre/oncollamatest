RADIOLOGY CONSULT - ONCOLOGY IMAGING DILEMMA

PATIENT: 61M with metastatic melanoma on immunotherapy

CLINICAL CONTEXT:
Stage IV melanoma (BRAF V600E mutant) diagnosed April 2024. Initially treated with dabrafenib/trametinib (BRAF/MEK inhibitor combo) but progressed after 4 months with new brain metastases.

Switched to pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) monotherapy in September 2024. Treatment initiated given progression on targeted therapy.

BASELINE IMAGING (September 2024 - pre-immunotherapy):
- Brain MRI: 3 parenchymal metastases (largest 1.8 cm right frontal lobe)
- CT chest: Multiple bilateral lung nodules, largest 2.2 cm RUL
- CT abdomen: Liver metastases x 4, largest 3.1 cm segment 8
- LDH: 520 U/L

FOLLOW-UP IMAGING (November 2024 - after 4 cycles pembrolizumab):
- Brain MRI: Right frontal lesion INCREASED to 2.6 cm with surrounding edema. Two other lesions stable.
- CT chest: Lung nodules INCREASED in size and NUMBER. New nodules appeared. Largest now 3.4 cm RUL.
- CT abdomen: Liver lesions appear LARGER, largest now 4.2 cm with irregular enhancement. Perilesional inflammatory changes noted.
- LDH: 380 U/L (DECREASED from baseline)

RADIOLOGY IMPRESSION: "Concerning for disease progression"

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT - CONFUSING PICTURE:
Patient feels BETTER clinically:
- Improved energy levels
- Weight stable (previously losing)
- No new neurological symptoms despite larger brain lesion
- Skin exam: Two subcutaneous nodules that were present at baseline now SOFTER and less palpable

Discordance between imaging (showing progression) and clinical status (improving) + biochemical response (LDH decreasing).

DIAGNOSTIC UNCERTAINTY:
Is this true progression or pseudoprogression/inflammatory response to immunotherapy?
- Timing: 8-10 weeks after starting immunotherapy is classic for pseudoprogression
- Clinical improvement contradicts radiographic worsening
- LDH improvement suggests tumor burden reduction despite size increase
- Perilesional inflammation on imaging suggests immune infiltration

MANAGEMENT DILEMMA:
Options:
1. Continue pembrolizumab through apparent progression (per iRECIST criteria)
2. Obtain tissue biopsy of enlarging lesion to distinguish viable tumor vs inflammation/necrosis
3. Repeat imaging in 4-6 weeks to assess trajectory
4. Add ipilimumab (CTLA-4 inhibitor) to pembrolizumab for combination immunotherapy
5. Switch to alternative therapy

Tumor board recommendation: Continue pembrolizumab, repeat imaging 6 weeks, biopsy if continued growth.
