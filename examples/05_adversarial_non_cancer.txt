CARDIOLOGY CONSULTATION NOTE

PATIENT: 55-year-old male
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest pain and dyspnea on exertion

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Patient presents with 6-month history of progressive exertional chest discomfort and shortness of breath. No rest pain. Risk factors include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, former smoker (quit 10 years ago, 30 pack-year history).

CARDIAC WORKUP:
- Stress test: Positive for inducible ischemia at 85% maximum predicted heart rate
- Coronary angiography (November 2024): Severe triple vessel disease
  * 90% stenosis of proximal LAD
  * 85% stenosis of mid-RCA
  * 70% stenosis of proximal LCx
- Echocardiogram: Preserved ejection fraction (55%), mild diastolic dysfunction
- Cardiac biomarkers: Troponin negative, BNP mildly elevated at 180 pg/mL

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Hypertension (on lisinopril, metoprolol)
- Hyperlipidemia (on atorvastatin)
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 7.1%, on metformin)
- Benign prostatic hyperplasia

FAMILY HISTORY: Father died of myocardial infarction at age 62. Brother with coronary artery disease.

ASSESSMENT:
Symptomatic severe triple vessel coronary artery disease without evidence of acute coronary syndrome. High-risk anatomy requiring revascularization.

PLAN:
1. Referral to cardiac surgery for CABG evaluation
2. Continue dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel)
3. Optimize medical therapy
4. Cardiac rehabilitation post-operatively

This is a cardiovascular case requiring surgical intervention.
