PATHOLOGY DISCORDANCE CASE - SECOND OPINION REQUESTED

PATIENT: 68F with lung mass, conflicting biopsy results

CLINICAL PRESENTATION:
4.2 cm right lower lobe lung mass identified on screening CT. FDG-avid on PET (SUVmax 14.5). Patient asymptomatic. Heavy smoking history (45 pack-years, quit 5 years ago).

INITIAL BIOPSY #1 (CT-guided core biopsy, October 2024):
DIAGNOSIS: Small cell carcinoma
- Tumor cells with high N/C ratio, nuclear molding, salt-and-pepper chromatin
- Extensive necrosis present
- Immunohistochemistry:
  * Synaptophysin: Positive (diffuse)
  * Chromogranin: Positive (focal)
  * TTF-1: Positive
  * CD56: Positive
  * Ki-67: 90%
PATHOLOGIST INTERPRETATION: "Consistent with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). Recommend limited vs extensive stage workup."

REPEAT BIOPSY #2 (Bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy, November 2024):
Performed due to clinical concern for sampling error (limited tissue in first biopsy)

DIAGNOSIS: Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features
- Glandular architecture visible in areas
- Some areas with neuroendocrine morphology
- Immunohistochemistry (repeated):
  * TTF-1: Positive (diffuse)
  * Napsin-A: Positive (focal - not seen in typical SCLC)
  * Synaptophysin: Positive
  * Chromogranin: Negative
  * CK7: Positive
  * p40: Negative
  * Ki-67: 60% (lower than initial biopsy)

PATHOLOGIST INTERPRETATION: "Favor adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation rather than pure SCLC. Napsin-A positivity supports adenocarcinoma. Consider large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) in differential."

MOLECULAR TESTING (from second biopsy):
- EGFR: Exon 19 deletion detected
- ALK: Negative
- ROS1: Negative
- PD-L1: TPS 5%

DIAGNOSTIC DILEMMA:
Two biopsies from same mass showing different results:
1. First biopsy: Small cell carcinoma phenotype
2. Second biopsy: Adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features + EGFR mutation

Possibilities:
A) Combined SCLC-NSCLC (mixed histology) - rare but documented
B) Sampling variation - different areas of heterogeneous tumor
C) Adenocarcinoma with extensive neuroendocrine differentiation mimicking SCLC
D) LCNEC misclassified initially as SCLC

CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
Treatment implications dramatically different:
- If SCLC: Platinum/etoposide chemotherapy, prophylactic cranial irradiation
- If EGFR+ adenocarcinoma: Osimertinib targeted therapy (much better prognosis)
- If LCNEC: Surgical resection if operable, or platinum-based chemotherapy

RECOMMENDATION:
Surgical resection planned to obtain definitive histology and guide adjuvant therapy. Intraoperative frozen section to be performed. Final pathology will determine post-operative management.
