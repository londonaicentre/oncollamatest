MOLECULAR TUMOR BOARD CASE PRESENTATION

PATIENT: 49F, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma

SURGICAL PATHOLOGY (May 2024):
Right hepatectomy for 8 cm mass segment 6/7 liver
Diagnosis: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, moderately differentiated
Staging: pT2 N1 M0 (3/8 regional lymph nodes positive, largest deposit 2.1 cm)
Stage IIIB by AJCC 8th edition
Margins: R0 resection
Perineural invasion: Present
Lymphovascular invasion: Present

COMPREHENSIVE GENOMIC PROFILING (Foundation Medicine):
Tumor Mutational Burden: 15 mutations/Mb (TMB-High)
Microsatellite status: MSS

ALTERATIONS DETECTED:
1. IDH1 R132C mutation (VAF 42%) - potentially actionable
2. FGFR2-BICC1 fusion (exon 17-exon 1) - actionable
3. TP53 R248W mutation (VAF 38%)
4. ARID1A truncating mutation (VAF 45%)
5. BAP1 loss (homozygous deletion)
6. CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion
7. PBRM1 splice site mutation (VAF 32%)
8. SMAD4 Q311* nonsense mutation (VAF 40%)
9. STK11 frameshift deletion (VAF 28%)
10. PIK3CA H1047R mutation (VAF 15%) - sub-clonal

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:
- PD-L1 (SP263): CPS 8
- dMMR: pMMR (intact MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2)

CTDNA ANALYSIS (Guardant360, August 2024 - post-op surveillance):
Circulating tumor DNA detected:
- FGFR2 fusion: Detected (0.08% VAF)
- IDH1 R132C: Detected (0.12% VAF)
- TP53 R248W: Detected (0.09% VAF)
Minimal residual disease present despite R0 resection.

GERMLINE TESTING (Invitae):
Pathogenic variant identified: BRCA2 c.5946delT (p.Ser1982fs) - germline
Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, family history: mother with ovarian cancer age 54, maternal aunt with breast cancer age 47

DISCUSSION:
Multiple actionable alterations:
1. FGFR2 fusion: Consider pemigatinib or infigratinib (FDA approved for cholangiocarcinoma)
2. IDH1 mutation: Ivosidenib approved for this indication
3. TMB-High + PD-L1 CPS 8: May benefit from pembrolizumab
4. BRCA2 germline: PARP inhibitor sensitivity possible
5. PIK3CA: Multiple PI3K inhibitors available in trials

CLINICAL DECISION:
Given detectable ctDNA indicating high-risk MRD, recommend adjuvant therapy. Prioritize FGFR2 inhibitor (pemigatinib) given level 1 evidence in cholangiocarcinoma. Consider IDH1 inhibitor if progression. Clinical trial with PARP inhibitor + immunotherapy combination also discussed given multiple vulnerabilities.
