MEDICAL ONCOLOGY CONSULTATION

62-year-old male, former smoker, presents with metastatic adenocarcinoma, primary site unknown.

Patient developed progressive right neck swelling over 3 months. CT neck revealed 4.5 cm right level III lymph node mass. FNA showed metastatic adenocarcinoma. Clinical examination unremarkable, no obvious primary lesion identified.

Extensive imaging to locate primary:
- PET-CT whole body: Multiple FDG-avid nodes (cervical bilateral, mediastinal, retroperitoneal). No obvious primary tumor identified. Largest node right neck 4.5 cm, SUVmax 12.3
- Upper endoscopy with biopsies: Normal, no gastric or esophageal lesions
- Colonoscopy: Benign polyps removed, no malignancy
- Bronchoscopy: Normal airways, random biopsies negative
- CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast: No lung mass, no renal/pancreatic mass
- Testicular ultrasound: Normal
- Serum tumor markers: CEA 85 (elevated), AFP normal, beta-HCG normal, PSA 1.2 (normal)

cervical node:
Metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma
IHC profile:
- CK7 positive (diffuse)
- CK20 negative
- TTF-1 negative
- Napsin-A negative
- CDX2 negative (rules out lower GI)
- Gata-3 negative
- PAX-8 negative (rules out renal/ovarian)
- p40 negative
- Chromogranin negative

This immunoprofile does not clearly point to a specific primary site. Pattern most consistent with pancreatobiliary or upper GI origin, but no lesion visualized despite thorough imaging.

NGS panel performed:
- KRAS G12D mutation detected
- TP53 mutation
- No actionable alterations (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, HER2 negative)
- MSI-stable, TMB-low (3 mutations/Mb)

DIAGNOSIS: Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary (CUP), unfavorable subset
Stage: IV (metastatic nodal disease)

PLAN: Empiric chemotherapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel or modified FOLFIRINOX. Patient counseled regarding uncertainties in treatment given unknown primary.
